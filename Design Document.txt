Purpose: Defines the visual identity and UI standards to ensure the app is accessible, trustworthy, and localized.

3.1 Design Principles

Mobile-First & Lightweight: Optimized for lower-end Android devices and 2G/3G networks common in India.
+1


High Contrast: UI must be visible outdoors in bright sunlight (for owners).


Trust-Centric: Use of clean icons and badges (e.g., Green Shield for Hygiene) to convey safety.

3.2 Visual Guidelines

Color Palette: 

Primary: #FF5733 (Vibrant Orange - appetizing, energetic).

Secondary: #FFC300 (Yellow - highlights, warnings).

Neutral: White backgrounds for readability, Dark Grey for text.

Status Indicators: Bright Green for "OPEN", Grey for "CLOSED".

Typography:


Font Family: "Inter" or "Roboto" (Google Fonts) - highly readable and supports multiple Indian scripts.


Sizing: Large text for Owner App buttons to accommodate varied literacy levels.

3.3 UI References (Mental Sandbox)
Inspiration: Look at Swiggy Delivery Partner App for simple toggle interfaces, and Google Maps for clear POI markers.

Hygiene UI: Similar to "TripAdvisor" amenity lists but specific to cleanliness (e.g., Icons for Gloves, Hairnets, Mineral Water).
